‚òû Github Action to wait / sleep during a job execution ‚è±

_**Note**: This action is supported on **all runners** operating systems (`ubuntu`, `macos`, `windows`)_

## üìö Usage

This action uses the Linux [sleep command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sleep) to wait for a specific time during a job execution.

SUFFIX may be:
- `'s'` for seconds (default), 
- `'m'` for minutes, 
- `'h'` for hours,
- `'d'` for days.

_**Note**: The `sleep command` on MacOS only works with seconds, therefore this action converts the SUFFIX automatically to the value in seconds._

### Example

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: GuillaumeFalourd/wait-sleep-action@v1
        with:
          time: '1m' # for 1 minute
```
